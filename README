An EOTreeObject is a EOEnterpriseObject in a table in which there is some sort of tree structure. For example, one
way to implement this is to have a "parent" pointer in every EO. There are other ways to do it. A Closure table can
implement a tree structure and several common operations may be much more efficient.

This class will allow you to use either implementation stragtegy with the same API.

This code is not all working at this point, but the design is there and some things are done. The WebObjects application
is launchable and demonstrates the current functionality.

There is an SQL file for creating the two tables demonstrating the two implementations. There are tests in the
TestTreeSuite. When they are implemented and pass, the code will be golden. The WebObjects application displays
the two trees side by side. One can use this app to test the code, adding or removing elements and checking that
the two trees do the same things as a result of any changes.

The EOTreeObject and EOTree classes are, right now, in the TreeFul application. But they will be pulled out into a
re-usable form as things progress.
